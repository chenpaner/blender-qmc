## Installation

Download the latest ZIPs from **Releases**.

Install them **individually** via ``Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Installâ€¦``.

## Usage

**PCOY** creates a Panel named **Pantone Color of the Year** under ``3D Viewport > Sidebar > PCOY``.

**MCMC** creates a Panel named **Mid-Century Modern Colors** under ``3D Viewport > Sidebar > MCMC``.

Select an Object in your view, and click a button to assign that color to it.

Set the ``Rename Material`` checkbox to ``True`` to update the Material Name.

## Caveats & Warnings

**This add-on does one very specific thing:**

It sets the Base Color of the Principled BSDF Shader node specifically named "Principled BSDF" -- which is created by default with all new Materials -- to a custom color. It also sets the Object's Viewport Display Color to the same color.

**This add-on will only affect the Active Material of the Currently Selected Object.**

The operation will fail if:
- No Object is selected
- The Active Object has no Material
- The Active Material does not include a Principled BSDF Shader named "Principled BSDF"

## Notes

The **PCOY** colors can be too harsh and saturated for large objects, but some of them pop nicely when used for details. Or use them as a starting point, and tweak them into something better. Cut the saturation by 50-75% and see what you get.

I use **Sand Dollar**, **2020 Bleached Coral**, and **2043 Dead Coral** a lot. [**The Ugliest Color in the World**](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ugliest-color-pantone_n_57570df6e4b0ca5c7b504538) is nice for for dirt, cracks, or crevices.

The **MCMC** colors are rather nice just as they are. The blues, greens, reds, and browns are great starters for terrains.

**Quick Tip** - To keep my Sidebar from getting overrun with Tabs, I use [**Simple Tabs**](https://chippwalters.gumroad.com/l/simpletabs) to collect all my Materials-related panels under one Tab labeled **MAT**.
