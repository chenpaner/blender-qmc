## Installation

Download the latest ZIPs from **Releases**.

Install them **individually** via ``Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Installâ€¦``.

Once activated, a new tab named **MAT** will appear in the 3D viewport sidebar.
- **PCOY** creates a panel named **Pantone Color of the Year**
- **MCMC** creates a panel named **Mid-Century Modern Colors**
- **HG71** creates a panel named **House & Garden 1971**
- **F58** creates a panel named **Ford Colors**

## Usage


Select an object in your view, and click a button to assign that color to it.

Set the ``Rename Material`` checkbox to ``True`` to change the material name.

## Caveats & Warnings

**This add-on does one very specific thing:**

It sets the Base Color of the Principled BSDF Shader node specifically named "Principled BSDF" -- which is created by default with all new materials -- to a custom color. It also sets the object's `Viewport Display > Color` to the same color.

**This add-on will only affect the Active Material of the Currently Selected Object.**

The operation will fail if:
- No object is selected
- The active object has no material
- The active material does not include a Principled BSDF Shader named "Principled BSDF"

## Notes

The **PCOY** colors can be too harsh and saturated for large objects, but some of them pop nicely when used for details. Or use them as a starting point, and tweak them into something better. Cut the saturation by 50-75% and see what you get.

I use **Sand Dollar**, **2020 Bleached Coral**, and **2043 Dead Coral** a lot. [**The Ugliest Color in the World**](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ugliest-color-pantone_n_57570df6e4b0ca5c7b504538) is nice for for dirt, cracks, or crevices.

The **MCMC** and **HG71** colors are rather nice just as they are. **MCMC's** blues, greens, reds, and browns are great starters for terrains.

**F58** is good for vintage cars and machinery.
